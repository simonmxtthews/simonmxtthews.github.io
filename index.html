        <p>Hey, I'm Simon. As suggested from the title, I'm a guy from Toronto. More specifically perhaps, I'm a guy from Toronto who happens to love building things, especially on the internet.</p>
        <p>One day, I want to build physical things, as I did when I was a kid. I think this is the circle of life for most technical founders. Speaking of which, Canada is in desparate need of orbital launch capabilties.</p>
        </p>
        <h2>SideQuests</h2>
        <p>My main project is SideQuests, an experience-sharing platform meant to get you back outside. Think of pokemon go, but for catching experiences.</p>

        <h2>thirdauthor</h2>
        <p>I built thirdauthor in three days. It's the simplest journaling platform with subtle social features. I made it for myself, but some friends liked it, so I decided to polish it and ship it.</p>
